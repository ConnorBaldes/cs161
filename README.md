# CS161: Introduction to Computer Science I

## Course Description
CS161 covers the fundamentals of computer science, focusing on problem-solving, software engineering, and object-oriented programming. The course introduces algorithm design, program development, and key programming concepts in C++. Topics include variable types, control flow, functions, arrays, and recursion, and students will apply these concepts through practical projects.

## Course Objectives
- Design and implement programs using control statements such as selection, repetition, and recursion.
- Develop programs utilizing variables, constants, operators, and data structures like arrays and strings.
- Apply the principles of object-oriented programming and abstraction.
- Debug syntax and runtime errors effectively.
- Implement recursive algorithms and understand when to use recursion versus iteration.
- Follow basic software engineering principles and ensure program quality.
- Understand memory management and pointers in C++.

## Projects

### The Size of Numbers in C++
Explore the size of different types of numbers in C++ by using preprocessor macros, `sizeof()`, and the `pow()` function. This project helps understand memory limitations in C++ and calculates values based on the size of data types.

#### Tasks:
- Print preprocessor macros for signed and unsigned types.
- Use `sizeof()` and `pow()` to calculate the size and limit of number types.
- Implement program style guidelines with appropriate comments.

### Variables and Conditionals
Create a text adventure game using if-statements and conditionals to design paths and random outcomes. Handle user input and implement a decision-making structure with nested if-statements.

#### Tasks:
- Create a text adventure with branching paths.
- Implement a random element that influences the user's journey.
- Ensure proper handling of user input and validation.

---

### Conditionals and Loops
Design a card game similar to BlackJack, where players bet against the dealer and try to reach a total closer to 21 without busting. Handle multiple players, bets, and gameplay mechanics.

#### Tasks:
- Simulate a card game using conditionals and loops.
- Handle user input for multiple players and bets.
- Implement logic for the dealer's behavior and player outcomes.

### Functions
Create a program that calculates a business trip expense report. The program will handle expenses like airfare, car rental, meals, and hotel fees, with various reimbursement rules.

#### Tasks:
- Collect input for trip expenses (car rental, meals, etc.).
- Calculate total expenses and reimbursements based on company policies.
- Ensure proper validation of input and handling of invalid data.

### 1D Array and Recursion
This project includes two parts: Word Frequency and Recursive Fractals. For Word Frequency, count the occurrence of specific words in a paragraph. For Recursive Fractals, generate patterns using recursion.

#### Tasks:
- Implement word frequency calculation using dynamic arrays.
- Create a fractal pattern using recursion with specific input parameters.

### 1D and 2D Arrays
Simulate heat diffusion using a 1D or 2D model. The program will calculate temperature diffusion over time using the explicit method for finite difference approximations.

#### Tasks:
- Simulate heat diffusion using arrays.
- Implement the explicit method and calculate stability based on input parameters.
- Handle 1D and 2D simulations and print results at each time interval.
